# <Challenge-6-Weather-Dashboard>

## Description

I was tasked with creating a readme generator using node js and inquirer which would take the user's inputs and display them on the appropriate sections of a readme.md file.

The completion of this project allowed me to develop an understanding for using inquirer along with the long range of applications nodejs has.
